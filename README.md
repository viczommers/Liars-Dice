# Liars-Dice ðŸŽ²
Calculate binomial probability of a bet in a game of Liars Dice (Perudo).
This dashboard visually illustrates the exponential decay of probabilities, as bets are raised beyond the expected value of a single die roll. Even though Liars Dice involves imperfect information, players can develop optimal long-run strategies based on aggregate probabilistic outcomes.

ABOUT:
> Liars Dice is a dice rolling game where players make bids on the number of dice with a specific face value that they believe are present among all players' hidden dice. 
> Each bid affects the probability of the next bid being true or false. The dice have a finite number of sides (typically 6).
> The probability of rolling a specific face value on a single die is 1/6. 1s are wild and can represent any other face value during bidding. 
>
>As the game progresses, players make bids based on their estimation of the number of dice with a specific face value that are present among all players' dice. The probability of a bid being true or false depends on the bid itself and the previous bids made by other players.
>
>For example, if a player bids that there are at least 3 dice with a face value of 3, the probability of this bid being true or false depends on how many dice are left in the game. 
>The discrete nature of the dice and the sequential bidding process contribute to the dynamic and probabilistic nature of Liars Dice.
